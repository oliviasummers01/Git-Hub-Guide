      <h2>Step 3: Basic Git Operations in VS Code</h2>
      <h3>Perform basic Git operations: status, add, commit, push, and pull through the VS Code GUI.</h3>
      <p>To perform basic operations, we will need a sample file. I will be using an already populated file but, you can mock up some code just to understand the procces.
         To create or add a new file, select either prompt on the VS Code welcome page. Add  your content
          and then save the new document. Once you are ready, we can then <b>commit</b> the changes. To commit changes, move to the source pannel on the left side of VS code.
          You must then stage the changes by clicking the plus sign next to any file  you want to add to this commit. Type a message for each commit you create. Then click the Commit Button below the message you created.
        The last step is to <b>push</b> the commit to github. You will select the "..." and click push. Once it has been bushed, you can then travel to your <a href="https://github.com"> Git Hub</a> repository and see that your file has been pushed along to GitHub with your message.  </p>

      <h2>Step 4: Branching with VS Code</h2>
      <h3>Use VS Code to create and switch between branches.</h3>
      <p>To <b>create</b> a new branch in VS Code, make sure all of your changes have been commited first. Then go to your command palette (COMMAND + SHIFT + P) and type ">Git Create Branch".
        You will then be prompted to name your branch and then press enter. Your branch is now created and you can see it's creation in the output section of your terminal.
        In order to <b>switch<b> all you need to do is select the branch listed in the bottom corner of the VS code page.  You will then be prompted with a pop up showing each branch listed. To switch, simply select the branch you want to be on.
        To confirm that you have switch, either check in your output section of the terminal or simply check the bottom corner of the VS code page to view the branch your currently on.
        </p>
      <h3>Understand the concept of branching for feature development or bug fixes.</h3>
      <p>Branches allow developers to work on isolated tasks without affecting the main codebase. This promotes parallel development, making it efficient to introduce new features or address bugs.
         Once the work is complete, branches can be merged back into the main branch, ensuring a seamless integration of changes. Git's branching concept enhances collaboration and code organization, 
         enabling teams to manage and implement complex projects more effectively.</p>

      <h2>Step 5: Working with Remote Repositories</h2>
      <h3>Add and manage remote repositories directly from VS Code.</h3>
      <h3>Push to and pull from these remotes using the VS Code interface.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 6: Pull Requests and Code Reviews within VS Code</h2>
      <h3></h3>Create pull requests using GitHub and VS Code.</h3>
      <h3>Review and discuss pull requests.</h3>
